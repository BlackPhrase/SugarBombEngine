# SugarBombEngine

Gamebryo game engine reimplementation (primarily for Fallout 3/New Vegas)

## General Notes

SugarBombEngine is id Tech 4 and OpenMW based engine, forked from RBDOOM-3-BFG, OpenTechEngine and OpenMW.

This is a reimplementation of the Gamebryo(/NetImmerse) engine which Fallout 3 game is powered by  
To be more specific, it's a reimplementation of Bethesda's engine branch which is significantly diverged from the original Gamebryo 
(yes, that particular Gamebryo engine everyone usually talking about and that performs like garbage; 
and it's actually better to call it an improved NetImmerse engine, but calling it Gamebryo is more popular)

This release does not contain any game data, the game data is still covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual
