# SugarBombEngine Contributing Guidelines

(DEEP WIP)

Some general rules:

* Base your changes above the dev branch by creating a new one called "dev-%your_nickname%"
* Base your sub-branches (branches which will be used to work on a specific feature/bugfix/etc) above your "dev-%your_nickname%" branch
* If you have the sub-branches you were working on you need to merge them into your "dev-%your_nickname%" branch first before opening a Merge Request
* Create a new Merge Request which will be applied above the dev branch mentioned earlier ("%your_repo%/dev-%your_nickname%" branch -> "%official_repo%/dev" branch)
